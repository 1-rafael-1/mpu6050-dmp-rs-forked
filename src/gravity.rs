//! Gravity Vector Calculations
//!
//! The gravity vector represents the direction of gravitational acceleration
//! relative to the sensor's orientation. This is crucial for:
//! - Determining the sensor's orientation relative to Earth
//! - Separating gravity from linear acceleration
//! - Converting between quaternions and Euler angles
//!
//! The vector components indicate:
//! - x: Forward/backward tilt (pitch)
//! - y: Left/right tilt (roll)
//! - z: Vertical alignment (1.0 when level)

/// A 3D vector representing the direction of gravity relative to the sensor.

/// Properties:
/// - When the sensor is perfectly level:
///   * x = 0 (no forward/backward tilt)
///   * y = 0 (no left/right tilt)
///   * z = 1 (gravity points straight down)
/// - The vector magnitude should always be approximately 1g
